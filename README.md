# AO3-Tone-Marks
"Tone Marks II" is based on GodofLaundryBasket's [Google Docs Tone Mark Script](https://godoflaundrybaskets.dreamwidth.org/3315.html) and Cathalinaheart's [Tone Marks](https://github.com/Cathalinaheart/AO3-Tone-Marks) tampermonkey script. This version may break at any time; whenever I have a stable version I'll try to contribute back to Cathalinaheart's repo.

## Current features not yet in Cathalinaheart's version:
- Support for Word of Honor, TGCF, and King's Avatar (I'm not actually in the latter two fandoms, so idk how good I managed to get the support)
- Ability to style replacements using an ao3 skin. Add the following to your site skin to e.g. underline replaced words:
```css
.replacement {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
