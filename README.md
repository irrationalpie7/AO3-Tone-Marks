# AO3-Tone-Marks
"Tone Marks II" is based on GodofLaundryBasket's [Google Docs Tone Mark Script](https://godoflaundrybaskets.dreamwidth.org/3315.html) and Cathalinaheart's [Tone Marks](https://github.com/Cathalinaheart/AO3-Tone-Marks) tampermonkey script. Please use Cathalinaheart's script; I'll contribute back to it as I add things here; this is mostly just a scratch workshop for myself.
